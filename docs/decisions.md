# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR-001: Separation of Native Shell and Web WYSIWYG Editor
- **Decision:** Use Rust + GTK4 + `gtk4-layer-shell` for native window lifecycle and WebKitGTK 6.0 embedding Tiptap/ProseMirror for the editor.
- **Rationale:** Native Wayland Layer Shell support is not available in Electron or standard Tauri without low-level C/Rust bridging. GTK4 and WebKitGTK 6.0 provide Wayland-native rendering with low memory overhead while Tiptap provides a rich, modular WYSIWYG editor engine.

## ADR-002: Individual Markdown Files for Note Persistence
- **Decision:** Store each post-it as a separate `.md` file with YAML front matter named by UUID.
- **Rationale:** Guarantees data ownership, portability, backup friendliness, and interoperability with other tools while avoiding single-point-of-failure database files.

## ADR-003: UI State Decoupling
- **Decision:** Store window coordinates, width, height, and display assignments in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/note-it/state.json`, not in the Markdown files.
- **Rationale:** Preserves Markdown cleanliness and portability across different screen setups.

## ADR-004: Official @tiptap/markdown & Tiptap 3 Ecosystem
- **Decision:** Use Tiptap 3 with the official `@tiptap/markdown` extension (all packages pinned to exact matching version `3.30.5`).
- **Rationale:** Third-party markdown extensions are deprecated and unmaintained. Tiptap 3's official markdown module provides built-in bidirectional tokenizers, stable AST handling, and extensible mark renderers for controlled HTML elements (`<u>`, `<mark>`, `<span>`).
